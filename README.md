#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project components:
 1. Created a Jupyter notebook prepare a training and testing dataset.
 2. Created one or more machine learning models.
 3. Fit the model to the training data.
 4. Evaluate the trained model(s) by using testing data (with include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance).
 5. Show the predictions by using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions for the 2 models used in this project.
 6. Additional background reference/screenshots included in the project presentation 
    (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-a_OaHhJ6utz6_fey4Xo57xQ5LgIJpduZK3igTMB4pg/edit?usp=sharing).
 7. Have used a new machine learning 'evaluation metric' (not covered in class) in this project.
 8. Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
