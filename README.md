# Project-2 #TODO

Project needs to fulfill the following requirements:
 1. Create a Jupyter notebook, Google Colab notebook, or Amazon SageMaker notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.
 2. Create one or more machine learning models.
 3. Fit the model(s) to the training data.
 4. Evaluate the trained model(s) by using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
 5. Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.
 6. Show the predictions by using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.
 7. Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, as well as to include in your presentation and your repoâ€™s README.md file.
 8. Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.
 9. Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
